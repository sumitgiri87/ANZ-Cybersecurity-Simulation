## 🔍 Task 1: Social Engineering Investigation  

### 📌 Task Overview  
In this task, you have been allocated a **set of emails** to investigate. Your job is to **determine whether each email is malicious or safe** and, if malicious, provide a brief report explaining why.  

Phishing emails attempt to **fraudulently obtain personal information** by impersonating a trustworthy entity. These messages often instruct users to **click a link** and enter their **credentials or personal details**.  

### 🎯 What You'll Learn  
- How to **identify phishing emails** and their characteristics  
- The importance of **SSL certificates** for verifying website authenticity  
- Best practices for **email security and phishing prevention**  

### 🛠️ What You'll Do  
1. **Analyze the provided emails** for phishing indicators  
2. **Check for SSL certificate verification** by ensuring the website:  
   - Uses `https://` instead of `http://`  
   - Displays a **security lock** or key icon in the address bar  
3. **Identify common phishing red flags**, including:  
   - Requests for **personal information** or security credentials  
   - Suspicious or mismatched **sender addresses**  
   - Unusual **links or attachments**  
4. **Write a brief report** on any identified phishing emails, explaining why they are malicious  

### 🔒 Best Practices for Avoiding Phishing Attacks  
- Treat all emails requesting **personal information** with suspicion  
- Never enter sensitive data on a **non-secure website**  
- Keep **antivirus and firewall software** up to date  
- Regularly **change passwords** for online accounts  
- If unsure about an email’s legitimacy, **contact ANZ Customer Service** before clicking any links
