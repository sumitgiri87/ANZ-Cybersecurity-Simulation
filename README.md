## 🔍 Task 1: Social Engineering Investigation  

### 📌 Task Overview  
You have been assigned **7 emails** to investigate. Some of these emails may contain **malicious content**, such as:  
- **Phishing attempts** targeting private account credentials  
- **Malicious attachments** that may contain malware  
- **Suspicious links** leading to fraudulent websites  

Your task is to **analyze each email** and determine whether it should be **blocked or released** based on its content and security risks.  

### 🎯 What You'll Learn  
- How to **identify phishing emails** and their warning signs  
- The impact of **malicious email content** in cybersecurity threats  
- How to properly **document and report findings** in an investigation  

### 🛠️ What You'll Do  
1. **Review the emails** provided in the PDF (`/resources/email_to_investigate.pdf`).  
2. **Analyze each email** for security threats, focusing on:  
   - **Sender authenticity** (email address verification)  
   - **Attachments** (malicious file indicators)  
   - **Embedded links** (safe vs. fraudulent URLs)  
   - **Content and language** (phishing red flags)  
3. **Use the provided answer template** (`/resources/email_analysis_template.docx`) to document:  
   - Whether the email is **safe or malicious**  
   - The **reasons** for classification (e.g., phishing attempt, suspicious attachment, domain mismatch)  
   - Suggested **actions** (block, release, or further review)  

### 🔒 Best Practices for Email Security  
- **Verify sender authenticity** before trusting any email.  
- **Hover over links** to check if they match the expected domain.  
- **Do not open attachments** from unknown or suspicious sources.  
- **Check for spelling errors, urgency, or threats**—common phishing tactics.  
- **Report suspicious emails** to IT/security teams rather than engaging with them.
